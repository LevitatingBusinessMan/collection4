 collection 4 - An efficient graphing front-end for collectd
=============================================================

About
-----

  collection 4 (c4) is a web-based front-end to the RRD files updated by
  collectd. It is designed to be highly efficient and handle large
  installations - with 50,000 and more RRD files - well.


Concepts
--------

  c4 lets you configure "graphs" in its config file. Each graph has a selector
  which determines which files will be used to draw the graph. The selector
  uses the host/plugin[-instance]/type[-instance] layout known from collectd.
  Each field of the selector may be one of two wildcard expressions:

    * "/any/"
      The field may be any value. The files will be grouped by the values of
      all "/any/" fields. Think of the "GROUP BY" SQL expression. Each grouping
      is called an "instance" which can be identified by the graph selector and
      the value of the "/any/" fields.

    * "/all/"
      As with the any-selector, the field may be any value. However, all files
      that only differ in the "/all/" field(s) will be printed in the same
      graph.

  Upon startup, c4 will read the configuration and scan the directory
  containing the RRD files. Each file is added to all matching graphs, either
  by adding it to the appropriate instance or by creating a new instance. I.e.
  each file may be used in multiple graphs.
